Welcome to My Portfolio!

Hello! My name is Adetola, and I’m a first-year student at Yale University studying Computer Science and Economics. This repository showcases the programming projects I create throughout
my academic journey.

As I continue to grow as a developer, I hope this portfolio reflects my progress in programming and serves as a way to present my skills to potential employers.
Feel free to explore my work, and don’t hesitate to reach out!
